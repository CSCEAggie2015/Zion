<p>Experiencing quicksand was definitely, whether I knew it or not, a checked-off bucket-list entry for sure. 
The grandeur of the mountain range contrasting the fine sand particles in the quicksand was amazing to witness.
After gaining the confidence from my local guide's instructions, it was so much to play around without sinking.
I absolutely can't wait to go back and explore more of Zion National Parket
