<p>Who better to know the lay of the land than the locals? One of the my favorite things about using Airbnb is the ability to soak up all the
    knowledge, recommendations and favorite spots from the local host. Luckily, our host was willing to actually be our Local Guide on a hike
    down the Log Jam. Learning important things such as where not to step to avoid disturbing the living soil and how exactly to step through 
    quicksand without sinking were major advantages to having a local guide.
