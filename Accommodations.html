<p>Choosing to stay in an Airbnb at Zion National Park provided certain comforts and amenities that I really appreciated embarking on a nature 
    trip in the heat of a pandemic. Having a full kitchen to use at my leisure made socially distanced meals much more attainable. I appreciated
    being able to wash my gear and hiking clothes at the end of the trip with the on-site washer and dryer.</p>

    The beautiful open format and walls full of windows in this Airbnb facilitated a continued awe-filled experience before and after the hike. 
    This particular home even mapped out the National Park on a striking wooden glass topped table. The location may have been one of the best 
    draws, being only a miles walk, drive or bike ride from the entrance to the park.
