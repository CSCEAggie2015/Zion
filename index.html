        <p> Zion National Park was always a place that I'd learned about in school growing up in Chicago and Texas, but couldn't fathom its
            immense beauty and wonder from the opposite coast. After discovering my love for hiking through college in the abundantly green
            Texas hills, I unlocked greater proximity to a plethora of travel destinations upon moving to Las Vegas. <br><br>I couldn't believe that
            the Grand Canyon, Death Valley and Zion National Park were all much closer than what I was used to when driving from Dallas to 
            San Antonio. The pandemic had just hit and my birthday was that same month in March of 2020. Instead of cancelling all my plans 
            to party, I decided to escape to nature and finally visit Zion. Explore the pages of this site to follow my exploration of Zion.
